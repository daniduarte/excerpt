## Configuration
There are a few options to help to costumize the plugin behavior:
* limit (number, default 50): It set the length of characters before to cut the content.
* suffix (string, default "..."): It set the ending word when the content was already cutted.
* dev (bolean, default FALSE): It set the development mode. When it's TRUE, the plugin will not prints the cutted content in the DOM, it will printed in the browser console with additional information to debug. Otherwise, if it's FALSE, it prints the cutted content normally in the DOM.
